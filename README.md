# Topic-Modeling-using-Latent-Semantic-Analysis
Have used BBC News Dataset for Topic Modeling.<br>
It identifies certain keywords from the topics that define those topics known as component terms. 
It forms clusters of similar documents. Also a new document is then classified to a particular topic. 
<br>Tf-IDF Vectorizer and Truncated Singular Value Decomposition are used to obtain the component terms.

#### The number of documents to be identified are set to 5. The clusters formed are shown in the image below.
